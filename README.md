    Blue Team Tools is exactly what it sounds like, a set of scripts and tools I've developed while working as a Blue Teamer published to this repository, because why not?

Tools:

checkip - Use the VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, or URLScan APIs to quickly do OSINT on potentially suspicious IPs or URLs

More tools will be added as I create them during my cyber adventures! Feel free to leave any feedback in comments, or at my twitter @Fr3ki_
